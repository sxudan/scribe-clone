# Documentation Tool - Chrome Extension

A Chrome extension that records user actions on webpages and automatically converts them into step-by-step documentation guides, similar to Scribe.

## Features

- **Action Recording**: Captures clicks, inputs, form submissions, and page navigations
- **Screenshot Capture**: Automatically captures screenshots for each recorded step
- **Multiple Export Formats**: Export guides as Plain Text, Markdown, or HTML
- **Simple UI**: Easy-to-use popup interface to start/stop recording
- **AI-Ready**: Architecture supports backend AI integration for enhanced documentation generation

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Setup

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Build the extension:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
4. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
5. Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in top right)
6. Click "Load unpacked" and select the `dist` directory
7. The extension icon should appear in your Chrome toolbar

## Usage

1. Navigate to any webpage you want to document
2. Click the extension icon in your toolbar
3. Click "Start Recording" to begin capturing actions
4. Perform the actions you want to document (clicks, form fills, etc.)
5. Click "Stop Recording" when finished
6. Click "Export Guide" and choose your preferred format (Text, Markdown, or HTML)
7. The documentation file will be downloaded automatically

## Development

### Build Commands

- `npm run build` - Build the extension for production (outputs to `dist/`)
- `npm run dev` - Build in development mode with watch mode (auto-rebuilds on changes)
- `npm run clean` - Remove the `dist` directory

### Development Workflow

1. Make changes to TypeScript files in the `src/` directory
2. Run `npm run dev` to watch for changes and auto-rebuild
3. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
4. Click the refresh icon on the extension card to reload
5. Test your changes

### TypeScript + React + Tailwind CSS

The project uses:
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **React** for the popup UI component
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling

All source files are in the `src/` directory:
- `types.ts` - Shared type definitions
- `popup.tsx` - Popup React component with Tailwind CSS
- `popup.css` - Tailwind CSS imports
- `content.ts` - Content script for event capture
- `background.ts` - Background service worker

The TypeScript/React files are compiled to JavaScript in the `dist/` directory using webpack. Tailwind CSS is processed through PostCSS and injected via style-loader.

## Configuration

### Backend AI Integration

To integrate with an AI backend service for enhanced documentation generation, edit `src/background.ts` and uncomment the API call section. Update the endpoint URL:

```typescript
const response = await fetch('YOUR_BACKEND_API_URL/generate-documentation', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    steps: steps,
    format: format
  })
});
```

## Icons

Icons are optional but recommended. To add icons:

1. Create icon files in the `icons/` directory:
   - `icon16.png` (16x16 pixels)
   - `icon48.png` (48x48 pixels)
   - `icon128.png` (128x128 pixels)

2. You can:
   - Use any image editor to create custom icons
   - Use an online icon generator
   - Open `create-icons.html` in your browser to generate simple placeholder icons with "DT" text

3. After adding icons, update `manifest.json` to include the icon references (see `icons/README.txt` for the exact code)

The extension will work without icons, but Chrome will show a default placeholder icon.

## Permissions

The extension requires the following permissions:
- `activeTab`: To interact with the current tab
- `storage`: To store recording state and steps
- `tabs`: To capture screenshots
- `scripting`: To inject content scripts
- `<all_urls>`: To work on any webpage


## Data Storage

Steps are stored temporarily in Chrome's local storage. They are cleared when:
- The user clicks "Clear Steps"
- The extension is uninstalled
- Browser data is cleared

## Future Enhancements

- Backend AI integration for natural language documentation
- Cloud storage for guides
- Sharing capabilities
- Step editing and reordering
- Video recording option
- Multi-page workflow support
